## Acknowledgments

This project was heavily inspired by these videos:
- [A.I. Learns to play Flappy Bird](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WSW-5m8lRMs)
  - This video inspired the idea of training an AI to automate flappy bird 
- [AI Teaches Itself to Play Flappy Bird - Using NEAT Python!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGHA-elMrxI)
    - This video provided a brief explanation of the NEAT-Python library, which I used as a foundation for this project
